# rf-ceiling-fan-remote

I was looking for a way to remote control my combo ceiling fan and light using voice control.  The simple solution I came up with was to use a relay module with an ESP32.  The relay module presses buttons on the fan remote by closing the contacts.  The ESP32 registers with an Adafruit IO account for cloud integration where a feed called "fan" is listening for input to send to the device.  You can create iOS Shortcuts which can be called via Siri: "Siri Fan On" or use Google Home Voice control via IFTTT.com integration - a Google Assistant "service" listens for commands and then an Adafruit IO sends commands to the feed.
